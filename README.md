# enso.works

My site [enso.works](https://enso.works "personal blog")

## Made with

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- and garbage code 😛

## Run it

Ok, As you already know how to run the next js app,
go ahead run the dev server and explore.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Project Design 

- [📚] Command pallet command(ctrl)+k with keyboard navigation | Not in use anymore since there is no navigation on the site
- [☀️] Light and Dark mode toggle custom NextJS component
