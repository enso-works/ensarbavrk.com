# enso.works

My personal blog and other interesting stuff. 



## Made with

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Sass
- 🤔 what else?

## Run it

Ok, As you already know how to run the next js app,
go ahead run the dev server and explore.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Project Design 

I've started this project with the atomic design, but most likely it will end up like garbage just to release the blog out there. Enjoy peeking into the code feel free to post pr :P
some custom components are:
- [📚] Command pallet command(ctrl)+k with keyboard navigation 
- [☀️] Light and Dark mode toggle custom NextJS component
