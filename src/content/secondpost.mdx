Lazy evaluation, a strategy that defers computation until it's absolutely needed, is not just lazy, it's efficient. It avoids unnecessary work until it's necessary to produce a result, making it a powerful concept in programming.
Lazy evaluation, despite its name, is a highly practical strategy. It makes the expression 'lazy' until explicitly called to evaluate a result. Which allows us to work with infinite lists and all forms of perceived infinity. This practicality is one of the key benefits of this technique.
